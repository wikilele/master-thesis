# Automating the deployment of cloud-native applications over multiple platforms

Master thesis at UniPi

### Abstract

Declarative deployment technologies are very popular nowadays.
With many different possibilities, committing to one tool might represent a form of lock-in. The Essential Deployment Meta Model, with its Transformation Framework and Decision Support System, was proposed to overcome this problem and ease the migration from one technology to another.The EDMM environment is still poorly integrated and there is room to automate the design of the deployment model. The scope of the thesis is to present the integration between the EDMM tool and Eclipse Winery; we will also propose a rule-based approach to improve the DSS and the user experience while modelling the application deployment.
